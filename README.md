- Github(Project Documentation & Portfolio)[Access](https://github.com/)


### Dataset Description
The dataset contains 8,523 entries across the following attributes:
- Item Fat Content, Item Type, Item Weight, Item Visibility
- Outlet Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type
- Outlet Establishment Year, Sales, and Rating


### Data Preparation

## <u>Key Insights<u>

### Actionable Findings
1. Outlet Type Impact: Supermarket Type1 outlets contribute the highest sales volumes consistently across multiple item categories.
2. High Sales Drivers are Medium outlet size locations in Tier 2 areas and also Items with higher ratings (4.5â€“5.0) significantly outperform others.
3. "Fruits and Vegetables", "Dairy", and "Snack Foods" lead sales, suggesting high demand for fresh and quick-consumption products.

### Optimization & Recommendation
1. Increase ad placements and discounts for top-performing categories during high-traffic times (e.g., weekends, holidays).
2. Rating-Sales Correlation: High-rated products could be prioritized in promotions.
3. Allocate more marketing resources, logistics support, and product variety to Tier 3 cities as they show strong sales despite often being underdeveloped markets.
4. Use Supermarket Type 1 as the flagship model for future store rollouts. Tailor marketing campaigns and exclusive product launches through this channel.
5. Maintain or slightly expand low fat product lines especially in high-performing areas, but test the growth of regular fat offerings in health-conscious zones (e.g., Tier 2).

### Unexpected Outcome
1. Some low visibility items (<0.01) still managed strong sales, indicating possible promotional campaigns or seasonal demand surges.


### Visualisations
Key visuals created include:
- Single Value Cards/KPIs: For Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Ratings
- Area Chart: For Outlet Establishment
- Donut Chart: For Fat Content
- Bar Charts (Horizontal): For Fat by Outlets, Item Types, Outlet Types.
- Stacked Bar Chart (Horizontal): Outlet Size.
- Visuals available in my Github repository's Visualizations folder.


### Limitations
- No time-series data to analyze seasonality.
- Rating appears skewed (mean ~4), possibly not a true customer review metric.
  

### Future Improvement
- Integrate time-based sales data for trend and seasonality analysis.
- Use external data (e.g., weather, location demographics) for demand forecasting.
- Expand analysis with real-time sales dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
- Build a predictive sales model using regression and ensemble methods.

### Conclusion
